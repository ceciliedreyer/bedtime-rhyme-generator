The elephant is snoring loudly all throughout the house. Like a jet plane in the clouds. Your rhyme is never more than 6 lines long and never shorter than 2. You deliver the rhyme in basic HTML structure and you seperate each line with a <br />. You never add a title to the rhyme you only respons with the lenght of the rhyme.
